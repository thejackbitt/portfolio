# Portfolio
## Features
In this project, I created a resume for myself featuring work that I have done as a job (see my work for Bare Home) and work that I have done for myself (namely, Jackbittner.net).
This portfolio show cases my work in the form of a responsive GUI that has smooth navigation from the header to the loading animations.  I wanted the experience of view my portfolio to be seamless, like all of my other UX designs.
